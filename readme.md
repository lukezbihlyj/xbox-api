# Xbox API

~~An open-source API that enables developers to fetch Xbox Live profile and achievement data. I no longer support nor maintain this project, as time doesn't allow for it. If you want to be able to pull to this repository and maintain it for me, then let me know via email or something.~~

This project has been picked up by XboxLeaders, and can be found here: https://github.com/XboxLeaders/XboxLiveAPI
